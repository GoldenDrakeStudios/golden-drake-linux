### Removal of i686 code/releases

We have decided to completely remove i686 code, since currently the compilation
process did not work properly and nobody was willing to maintain it.

If someone willing to maintain i686 support steps up, we will gladly re-add it.
Please either message us on [Telegram](https://t.me/anarchy_linux)
or using the [contact form](https://www.anarchylinux.org/contact.html)
