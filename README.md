# About

[GoldenDrakeLinux](https://goldendrakestudios.com/golden-drake-linux/) is an [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) installer designed for gamers and game developers. Like the [Anarchy](https://www.anarchylinux.org/) installer it's based on, GoldenDrakeLinux is not an independent distro. Rather, it's simply a convenient method for installing a customized version of the Arch distro.

The first public release of GoldenDrakeLinux will be ready...soon. In the meantime, we recommend downloading the [latest Anarchy installer](https://www.anarchylinux.org/download/) or, for an even more user-friendly Arch-based experience, take a look at [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/download/) or [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/download/). We can also highly recommend the Ubuntu-based [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/download.php), source of our beloved Cinnamon desktop environment, as well as the various flavors of [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) itself.
